# How to install AgarVM
### Setup
Go to https://github.com/codespaces then on the blank template, click "Use this template". It will then open
a new tab thingy and sorta just let it load. In the console it creates, move on to the next step and paste the 
commands in it.
### Commands
Copy and paste the following in the console. (Copy with Ctrl+C and paste in the console with Ctrl+Shift+V)
```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kk123121/agarvm/main/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
### Final steps
Now that you've done that, use the cli-gui setup installation to install the VM on your device. Once you have
done that you can now look a bit up on your terminal and you will see a "Ports" tab with a blue 1 on it. Click
that tab and you will see a blue link on the port 3000. Copy and paste that link, make sure the codespace tab
you used to install AgarVM is still there and bam. You are now in Agar! The next thing I think you should do
is read the "ArgarVM.txt" thing on your desktop. It will explain a lot about agar and just some general things
on how not to get cought. **Happy evading school!**

# PLEASE READ THIS!
If there are any bugs please add an issue on the github because I 
dont use this vm all the time as its a passion project after I found
out about VNC which will allow me to use linux servers in the browser.
