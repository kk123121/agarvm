========================================================================
- Fixed the errors with installing apps in the setup
- Added some new apps like krita, gzdoom and more!
- Added a custom wallpaper for agar because I felt like it needs one.
- Now theres a logo !!
========================================================================

If there are any bugs please add an issue on the github because I 
dont use this vm all the time as its a passion project after I found
out about VNC which will allow me to use linux servers in the browser.
